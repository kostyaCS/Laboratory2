# Find loactions near you, where films were shot
## Project from basics of programming UCU
With help of this script, you cand find points on map, near you coordinates, where films from the large database were shot.

All is preety simple: main.py supports input from terminal, so you don't have to open this file.

Before you try, you'll have to install some additional libraries, if you don't have them. So, type in command line:

![pip]("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116595519/219000083-346e102f-5075-4ce5-94bd-3b36888fed19.png")

Then, step inside your directory in terminal and let's check, for example, which films were shot near Lviv in 2012?
So, to run such script type in command line:

![terminal]("https://github.com/kostyaCS/Laboratory2/blob/main/script.png")

Here, first argument is a year, second - Lviv's lattitude, third - Lviv's longtitude and last one - file, in which we'll find films

Click Enter, wait a bit - and what we have?

![map big view]("https://github.com/kostyaCS/Laboratory2/blob/main/bigmap.png")

And let's take a look a bit closer:

![map closer view]("https://github.com/kostyaCS/Laboratory2/blob/main/closemap.png")

Looks like there were some films shot in Kyiv, Lviv and Poland!
